I've decided to compile a handful of meaningful problems that I wrote this year into a pdf document. Hopefully next year I will have written more cool problems and be able to make a much larger document! You can find the handout [here](/files/handouts/2023IR.pdf) or you can find it in the handouts tab of my website. Enjoy!
