Every year, I will be creating a handout showcasing various problems I've proposed for math competitions throughout that year. The purpose of this is to motivate myself to write more problems, and also to share insight on the problem writing process a bit. My goal for next year is to write at least 3 CMIMC problems. You can find the handout [here](/files/handouts/2023IR.pdf) or you can find it in the handouts tab of my website. Enjoy!
