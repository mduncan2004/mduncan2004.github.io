# About Me
Hi! My name is Michael, I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a Master's in Mathematics. I'm interested in trading and research roles at quantitative trading firms. Besides my career aspirations, I love solving problems and also teaching. I'm deeply interested in how to get students in low income and under represented areas interested in mathematics. Some of the things I am currently involved in include:
- Curriculum Development Intern at Expii 
- Co-Instructor of 98-099: Problem Solving through Solving Problems at CMU
- CMIMC Problem Writing Committee
