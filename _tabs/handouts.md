# What is this?
This is a page to store various math handouts I've written over the years. I have grouped them roughly by the material they cover.

## Calculus 
- [A Gentle Introduction to Competition Calculus](/files/handouts/GGCC.pdf): A textbook I wrote in my senior year of high school to help prep for FAMAT calculus competitions. The book assumes no prior knowledge of competition math, so a large portion of the text is meant to develop a foundation for calculus concepts, such as going over algebra manipulations, series, conics, trigonometry, etc. The book is quite long, and the early chapters are based on AOPS Intermediate Algebra and Precalculus, with calculus content thrown in when necessary. 
- [Polynomials Handout](/files/handouts/PolyHand.pdf): A handout I wrote for my high school's math team consisting of 31 problems pertaining to polynomials in calculus competitions, including problems from HMMT, SMT, BMT, and FAMAT. This is actually a great piece of exercise material if you can work through every problem.

## General 
- [2023 Year In Review](/files/handouts/2023IR.pdf): A handout showcasing some of the problems I've proposed for math competitions in 2023.
